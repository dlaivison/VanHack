The target of this project was to create a ETL data extraction from openstreetmap.org in order to gather information about the main restaurants in Sao Paulo.
Information has been collected from openstreetmap.org website and after filtered into a Json file  to fill  a mongodb database.
The information collected was also analysed in R Studio in order to provide reports about food places in Sao Paulo.

My main target was to collect info about the food places in order to verify where was the most concentration of restaurants in Sao Paulo.
